# image-changer
Final project for my Computer Science 101 class - fall quarter 2021 
This code takes a PPM image as a text file and manipulates each individual pixel to change the way the image looks using Python and the PPM image file
Makes the image negative, high contrast, and grayscale - also remvoed the red, blue, and green pixels respectively. I have uploaded the Python code as well as each version of the image
I learned about how to access, read, write, and append to outside files in Python with this project. I also utilized classes and functions in Python. 

The images can't be seen in github yet, but the PPM versions of each one can be seen if you click download on each file. They are labeled with what each one is
