# image-changer
Final project for my Computer Science 101 class - fall quarter 2021 
This was assigned to me as my final project for this class - it takes a PPM image and manipulates each individual pixel to change the way the image looks using Python and the PPM image file
Makes the image negative, high contrast, and grayscale - also remvoed the red, blue, and green pixels respectively. I have uploaded the Python code as well as each version of the image
